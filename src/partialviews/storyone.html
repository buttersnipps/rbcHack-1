There is only one way to return but you will have to face three different obstacles. Each obstacle will test your technical ability while promoting values every RBC employee strives for. We wish you all the best in your mission to successfully return to reality. </p>

						<h2>Challenge 1</h2>
						<p>While exploring the Cave of Pythons you run into two people that strangely look like the letters “R” and “B”. They are arguing about something and when you go to see what they’re fighting about you realize that they’ve written a code to try to hack their way out but are having trouble figuring it out. They beg and plead for you to help and at first you think about getting to the obstacle but realize that you’ll win together as one team, so you stay to help. </p>
